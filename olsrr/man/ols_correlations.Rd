\usage{
ols_correlations(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \code{lm}.}
}
\value{
\code{ols_correlations} returns an object of class \code{"ols_correlations"}.
An object of class \code{"ols_correlations"} is a data frame containing the
following components:

\item{Zero-order}{zero order correlations}
\item{Partial}{partial correlations}
\item{Part}{part correlations}
}
\description{
Zero-order, part and partial correlations.
}
\details{
\code{ols_correlations()} returns the relative importance of independent
variables in determining response variable. How much each variable uniquely
contributes to rsquare over and above that which can be accounted for by the
other predictors? Zero order correlation is the Pearson correlation
coefficient between the dependent variable and the independent variables.
Part correlations indicates how much rsquare will decrease if that variable
is removed from the model and partial correlations indicates amount of
variance in response variable, which is not estimated by the other
independent variables in the model, but is estimated by the specific
variable.
